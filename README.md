# Checkers-Game
An ongoing Web Application project which allows a player to play Checkers against the computer. Rules and graphics have been properly implemented and the game works with limited functionality. Final update on user input manipulation up and coming. (Right now a user can move by requesting any legal move but now user will be allowed to click on a checker and move it instead).
